# MDP - Group 17

This repository contains the code written for the Mirte Master robot in our Multidisciplinary Project in 2023/24 Q4 at the TU Delft.

The `mirte_base_station` code is meant to be ran on the laptop connected to the Mirte Master. Please see the README in that folder for further details.

The `mirte_robot_src` folder is meant to be build on the robot itself.
